### Autoregressive

An AR(1) autoregressive process is one in which the current value is based on the immediately preceding value,
while an AR(2) process is one in which the current value is based on the previous two values.
An AR(0) process is used for white noise and has no dependence between the terms.

    By JASON FERNANDO  

    A statistical model is autoregressive if it predicts future values based on past values.
    For example, an autoregressive model might seek to predict a stock's future prices based on its past performance.

    - Autoregressive models predict future values based on past values.
    - They are widely used in technical analysis to forecast future security prices.
    - Autoregressive models implicitly assume that the future will resemble the past.
    - Therefore, they can prove inaccurate under certain market conditions, such as financial crises or periods of rapid technological change.
